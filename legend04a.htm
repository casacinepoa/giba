              * Fotios Karamitroglou was born in Thessaloniki, Greece,
              on June 30, 1971. He entered the School of English at the
              Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1989. He received
              a First Degree Diploma in English Language and Literature
              in 1993. After serving in the Greek Army as a Reserve
              Cadet Officer, he moved to England to earn a Masters
              Degree at the University of Manchester Institute of
              Science and Technology (UMIST), sponsored by the Greek
              State Scholarship Foundation (IKY). He received his M.Sc.
              in Translation Studies in December 1996 and remained at
              UMIST for a Ph.D. research in Audiovisual Translation (to
              be awarded in July 1998). Dr. Karamitroglou is a member of
              the European Association for Studies in Screen Translation
              (ESIST) and of the British Institute of Translation and
              Interpreting (ITI). Dr. Karamitroglou can be reached at:

              PREFACE<br>
              <br>
              Translation Studies is nowadays overwhelmed by a number of
              attempts to discard prescriptive standpoints and adopt
              new, descriptive directions. As a consequence, the
              research effort has been shifted from an investigation of
              things that should be done to an investigation of things
              that are being done.<br>
              <br>
              Audiovisual/Screen Translation is not left out of the
              trend. In Europe, current research into subtitling is
              oriented towards an attempt to describe the various
              subtitling practices around the countries of the continent
              rather than to dictate what practices should rather be
              followed. In other words, the attempt nowadays is rather
              to describe the various subtitling conventions being
              followed throughout Europe, rather than to impose new
              ones. However, there are a few undeniable realistic
              parameters that cannot pass unnoticed: a) the movement
              towards a United Europe necessitates the adoption of
              common practices that would enable the participating
              countries to operate as a unified body, b) new
              technological developments in mass media and communication
              (e.g. digital TV) are bound to overcome the limited
              physical borders of the participating countries, leading
              to the creation of a pan-European market audience. In such
              a unified framework of European mass communication,
              subtitling-as a means of overcoming linguistic barriers
              between the nations-will come to play a critical role.
              Large satellite broadcasting companies around the
              continent have already stressed the need for a unifying
              code of subtitling practices, a code that would enable
              them to reach the various individual country audiences
              through a unique set of subtitling standards that would
              not violate the already established conventions within the
              various countries.<br>
              <br>
              At a first glance, such an attempt or a "desire" looks
              rather futile. It is impossible to deviate from an already
              established convention without causing some turbulence
              amongst the subjects/recipients of the convention. This,
              however, does not mean that the deviation from the current
              convention will not be gradually accepted, replacing old
              practices with new ones and gradually formulating a new
              ruling convention, provided that the transition is smooth
              both in quantitative and qualitative aspects. This would
              mean that a limited number of the new set of suggested
              practices are initially introduced into a limited number
              of situations, steadily expanding to cover the whole set
              of the new suggested practices, as well as all of the
              applicable situations. Considering the above, I believe
              that what satellite broadcasting companies demand nowadays
              is both reasonable and feasible, especially since the
              already existing number of descriptive studies on human
              social viewing behaviour, as well as on human
              physiological eye movement and brain function, are sound
              enough to provide the basis for such an initial attempt.<br>
              <br>
              The following paper departs from such descriptive studies
              but goes on to adopt a clearly prescriptive perspective.
              Its aim is to provide a unifying formula based on thorough
              scientific research that could bridge the different
              subtitling conventions currently operating within the
              various European countries, to cater for the needs of the
              individual European viewer and address the European
              audiovisual audience market as a whole.<br>
              <br>
              Towards a Standardisation of Subtitling Practices in
              Europe:<br>
              <br>
              Guidelines for Production and Layout of TV Subtitles<br>
              <br>
              1. General aim<br>
              <br>
              The general practice of the production and layout of TV
              subtitles should be guided by the aim to provide maximum
              appreciation and comprehension of the target film as a
              whole by maximising the legibility and readability of the
              inserted subtitled text.<br>
              <br>
              2. Spatial parameter / layout<br>
              <br>
              Position on the screen: Subtitles should be positioned at
              the lower part of the screen, so that they cover an area
              usually occupied by image action which is of lesser
              importance to the general aesthetic appreciation of the
              target film. The lowest line of the subtitles should
              appear at least 1/12 of the total screen height above the
              bottom of the screen, so that the eye of the viewer does
              not have to travel a long distance towards the lowest part
              of the screen to read it. Space should also be provided on
              the horizontal axis, so that, again, the eye of the viewer
              does not have to travel a long distance along the sides of
              the screen in order to read a subtitle line. To this end,
              image space of at least 1/12 of the total screen width
              should be provided to the left of the first character and
              at least 1/12 of the total #screen width to the right of
              the last character, for each subtitle line. Subtitles
              could be positioned towards the upper part of the screen
              only in extreme cases where visual material (linguistic or
              other) of vital importance to the appreciation and the
              comprehension of the target film is exposed at the
              pre-determined part of the screen where subtitles would
              otherwise be inserted.<br>
              <br>
              Number of lines: A maximum of two lines of subtitles
              should be presented at a time. This would guarantee that
              no more than 2/12 of the screen image would be covered by
              subtitles at a time. In the case of a single-line
              subtitle, this should occupy the lower of the two lines,
              rather than the top line in order to minimise interference
              with the background image action.<br>
              <br>
              Text positioning: The subtitled text should be presented
              centered on its allocated line(s). Since most of the image
              action circulates around the centre of the screen, this
              would enable the eye of the viewer to travel a shorter
              distance in order to reach the start of the subtitle. An
              exception is the case of "double text" (i.e. dialogue
              turns initiated by dashes and presented simultaneously on
              a two-line subtitle) which should be aligned to the left
              side of the screen, following the conventions of printed
              literature that require# dialogue turns introduced by
              dashes to be left-aligned on the printed page (see also
              the entry of "Dashes" in section 3 "Punctuation and letter
              case").<br>
              <br>
              Number of characters per line: Each subtitle line should
              allow around 35 characters in order to be able to
              accommodate a satisfactory portion of the (translated)
              spoken text and minimise the need for original text
              reduction and omissions. An increase in the number of
              characters, attempting to fit over 40 per subtitle line,
              reduces the legibility of the subtitles because the font
              size is also inevitably reduced.<br>
              <br>
              Typeface and distribution: Typefaces with no serifs are
              preferable to fonts with serifs, since the visual
              complexity added to the latter results in a decrease in
              the legibility of the subtitled text. Typefaces like
              Helvetica and Arial are qualified. Proportional
              distribution (like the one used on the current document
              and on most Word Processors) rather than Monospace
              distribution (usually used on typewriters) saves the space
              required to fit the desired 35 characters into a #subtitle
              line.<br>
              <br>
              Font colour and background: Type characters should be
              coloured pale white (not "snow-bright" white) because a
              too flashy pigment would render them tiring to the
              viewers' eye. They should also be presented against a
              grey, see-through "ghost box" rather than in a contoured
              format (surrounded by a shadowed edge) since it has been
              proven that it easier for the eye to read against a fixed
              rather than a varying/moving background. In addition, the
              colour of the "ghost box" (grey) is both neutral to the
              eye and gives the impression that it does not entirely
              block the background image.<br>
              <br>
              3. Temporal parameter / duration<br>
              <br>
              Duration of a full two-line subtitle (maximum duration):
              The reading speed of the "average" viewers (aged between
              14-65, from an upper-middle socio-educational class) for a
              text of average complexity (a combination of formal and
              informal language) has been proven to range between
              150-180 words per minute, i.e. between 2 1/2-3 words per
              second. This means that a full two line subtitle
              containing 14-16 words should remain on the screen for a
              maximum time of something less than 5 1/2 seconds.
              However, we would actually have to expand the estimate to
              around 6 seconds because one should also add about 1/4-1/2
              of a second that the brain needs to start processing the
              subtitle it has traced. It should be noted that equal to
              the importance of retaining a full two-line subtitle for
              at least 6 seconds to secure ample reading time, is the
              importance of keeping the same subtitle not more than 6
              seconds because this would cause automatic re-reading of
              the subtitle, especially by fast readers.<br>
              <br>
              Note: The average reading speed of children (aged 6-14)
              has been found to be around 90-120 words per minute. For
              the subtitling of children's programmes, then,
              calculations regarding the duration of the subtitles on
              screen should be estimated accordingly.<br>
              <br>
              Duration of a full single-line subtitle (maximum duration)
              : Although pure mathematics would lead us to the
              conclusion that for a full single-line subtitle of 7-8
              words the necessary maximum duration time would be around
              3 seconds, it is actually 3 1/2 seconds. This happens
              because for the two-line subtitle it is the visual bulk of
              the text that signals an acceleration of the reading
              speed. With the single-line subtitle this mechanism is not
              triggered. Once again, equal to the importance of keeping
              a full single-line subtitle for at least 3 1/2 seconds to
              secure ample reading time, is the importance of retaining
              the same subtitle for not more than 3 1/2 seconds because
              this would cause automatic re-reading of the subtitle,
              especially by fast readers. For similar reasons of
              automatic re-reading, in both cases of single-line and
              two-line subtitles, the duration time could be calculated
              and shortened down to the maximum of the reading time (3
              subtitled words per second or 1/3 of a second per
              subtitled word), if the text is lexically and
              syntactically easy to process and if the fast pace of the
              film action dictates such a reduction in the duration of
              the subtitles.<br>
              <br>
              Duration of a single-word subtitle (minimum duration): The
              minimum duration of a single-word subtitle is at least 1
              1/2 seconds, however simple the word is. Less time would
              render the subtitle as a mere flash on the screen,
              irritating the viewers' eye. Again, it should be noted
              that equal to the importance of retaining a single-word
              subtitle for at least 1 1/2 seconds to secure ample
              reading time is the importance of keeping the same
              subtitle for not more than 1 1/2 seconds because this
              would cause automatic re-reading of the subtitle,
              especially by fast readers.<br>
              <br>
              Leading-in time: Subtitles should not be inserted
              simultaneously with the initiation of the utterance but
              1/4 of a second later, since tests have indicated that the
              brain needs 1/4 of a second to process the advent of
              spoken linguistic material and guide the eye towards the
              bottom of the screen anticipating the subtitle. A
              simultaneously presented subtitle is premature, surprises
              the eye with its flash and confuses the brain for about
              1/2 a second, while its attention oscillates between the
              inserted subtitled text and the spoken linguistic
              material, not realising where it should focus.<br>
              <br>
              Lagging-out time: Subtitles should not be left on the
              image for more than two seconds after the end of the
              utterance, even if no other utterance is initiated in
              these two seconds. This is because subtitles are supposed
              to transfer the spoken text as faithfully as possible, in
              terms of both content and time of presentation and a
              longer lagging-out time would generate feelings of
              distrust toward the (quality of the) subtitles, since the
              viewers would start reflecting that what they have read
              might not have actually corresponded to what had been
              said, at the time it had been said.<br>
              <br>
              Between two consecutive subtitles: About 1/4 of a second
              needs to be inserted between two consecutive subtitles in
              order to avoid the effect of subtitles' "overlay." This
              time break is necessary to signal to the brain the
              disappearance of one subtitle as a piece of linguistic
              information, and the appearance of another. If no such gap
              is maintained, the viewers' eye cannot perceive the change
              of the new subtitled text, especially if it is of the same
              length as the antecedent one.<br>
              <br>
              "Overlay," "add-ons" and "cumulative text": All these
              terms are synonymous for the technique of presenting a
              "dynamic text," i.e. a dialogue or a briefly paused
              monologue, with its first part appearing first on the top
              line of the subtitle and the second part appearing
              consecutively on the bottom line of the subtitle while the
              first line still remains on screen. This technique is
              ideal for avoiding "spilling the beans," managing to
              reveal "surprise" information at the time of the actual
              utterance. Since it is a wild-card mechanism, it should be
              used cautiously.<br>
              <br>
              Camera takes/cuts: Subtitles should respect camera
              takes/cuts that signify a thematic change in the film
              product and, for this reason, they should disappear before
              the cuts. Different camera shots, fades and pans that do
              not indicate a major thematic change (e.g. a change from a
              long shot to a close-up and back) should not affect the
              duration of the subtitles at all as they do not signify a
              thematic change.<br>
              <br>
              4. Punctuation and letter case<br>
              <br>
              "Sequence dots" (or "ending triple dots") {...}: Three
              dots should be used right after the last character of a
              subtitle (no space character inserted), when the subtitled
              sentence is not finished on one subtitle and has to
              continue over the consecutive subtitle. The three
              "sequence dots" indicate that the subtitled sentence is
              #incomplete, so that the eye and the brain of the viewers
              can expect the appearance of a new flash to follow. The
              total absence of any kind of punctuation mark after the
              last character of the subtitle, as an alternative means of
              indicating the continuation of the subtitled sentence over
              the consecutive subtitle, does not provide such an obvious
              signal and, thus, the brain takes more time to process the
              new flash which appears less expectedly. Because of their
              particular function as signifiers of sentence
              incompleteness, the use of "sequence dots" to simply
              indicate ongoing thoughts or an unfinished utterance by
              the speaker should be considerably restricted.<br>
              <br>
              "Linking dots" (or "starting triple dots") {...}: Three
              dots should be used right before the first character of a
              subtitle (no space character inserted, the first character
              non-capitalised), when this subtitle carries the follow-up
              text of the previous uncompleted sentence. The tracing of
              the three "linking dots" signals the arrival of the
              expected new flash of subtitle, something anticipated
              because of the presence of "sequence dots" in the previous
              subtitle. The absence of any punctuation mark as an
              alternative means of indicating the arrival of the
              remaining part of an incomplete subtitled sentence does
              not provide such an obvious signal and as a result the
              brain takes more time to process the new subtitle flash as
              related to the previous subtitle. Because of their
              particular function as signifiers of sentence
              continuation, "linking dots" should always be used in
              conjunction with "sequence dots."<br>
              <br>
              Full stops {.}: The full stop, or period, should be used
              right after the last character of a subtitle (no space
              character inserted) to indicate the end of the subtitled
              sentence. This signals to the eye that it can go back to
              the image since there is no consecutive subtitle to
              anticipate. The absence of "sequence dots" as an
              alternative means of indicating the end of a subtitled
              sentence does not provide such an obvious signal and as a
              result the brain takes more time to process the fact that
              the subtitled sentence has actually been completed.<br>
              <br>
              Dashes and hyphens {-}: Dashes are used before the first
              character of each of the lines of a two-line subtitle
              (with a space character inserted each time) to indicate
              the exchange of speakers' utterances, namely a dialogue,
              presented either in a single flash as "static double
              text," or with the second speaker's exchange as an
              "overlay" to the first subtitle line, i.e. as "dynamic
              double text." When dashes are used to link words as
              hyphens no space characters should be inserted between the
              linked words<br>
              <br>
              Question marks {?} and exclamation points {!}: Question
              marks and exclamation points should be used to indicate a
              question or emphasis respectively, just like in printed
              materials, positioned right after the last character of a
              subtitle (no space character inserted).<br>
              <br>
              Note: For questions in Spanish, a question mark should
              also be inserted right before the first character (no
              space character inserted).<br>
              <br>
              Parentheses {( )} and brackets {[ ]}: Parentheses and
              brackets should be used to embrace comments which are
              explanatory to the preceding phrase. As the duration time
              for each subtitle is considerably limited and the
              convention of parentheses or brackets is not extremely
              widespread in printed materials either, they function as
              wild cards and, therefore, they should be used cautiously.<br>
              <br>
              Single quotation marks {' '}: Single quotation marks
              should be used just like in printed materials, in order to
              embrace alleged information. For reasons similar to the
              use of parentheses and brackets, single quotation marks
              should be used cautiously.<br>
              <br>
              Double quotation marks {" "} : Double quotation should be
              used just like in printed materials, in order to embrace
              quoted information. For reasons similar to the use of
              parentheses and brackets, double quotation marks should be
              used cautiously.<br>
              <br>
              Commas {,}, colons {:} and semicolons {;}: Commas, colons
              and semicolons should be used just like in printed
              materials, in order to suggest a short pause in the
              reading pace. Unlike full stops, sequence dots,
              exclamation points and question marks which could all be
              used to close a subtitled sentence, no subtitle flash
              should end in a comma, a colon or a semicolon because the
              inevitable pause in the reading pace, as a result of the
              time break between the two subtitles and the necessary
              time for the brain to process the new subtitle, would be
              disproportionately long in relation to the expected short
              pause. Again, for reasons similar to the use of
              parentheses and brackets commas, colons and semicolons
              should be used cautiously.<br>
              <br>
              Italics: Italics on the subtitled text should be used to
              indicate an off-screen source of the spoken text, (e.g.
              when there is a voice of someone contemplating something,
              speaking over the phone from the other end, or narrating
              something). They should also be used when retaining
              foreign-language words in their original foreign-language
              version (e.g. "He's got a certain je ne sais quoi.").<br>
              <br>
              Quotation marks {""} embracing text in italics: Quotation
              marks embracing text in italics should be used to indicate
              a public broadcast, i.e. spoken text coming from an
              off-screen source and addressed to a number of people
              (e.g. through a TV, a radio, or a loudspeaker). They
              should also be used when transferring song lyrics.<br>
              <br>
              Upper- and lower-case letters: Upper- and lower-case
              letters should be used just like in printed materials, as
              if the subtitle was to appear on paper. Subtitles typed
              only in upper-case letters should be used when
              transferring a display or a caption (i.e. a written sign
              that appears on the screen).<br>
              <br>
              Boldface and underline: Boldface and underline typing
              conventions are not permitted in subtitling.<br>
              <br>
              5. Target text editing<br>
              <br>
              From a single-line to a two-line subtitle: It is better to
              segment a long single-line subtitle into a two-line
              subtitle, distributing the words on each line. This is
              because the eye and the brain of the viewers render a
              two-line subtitle as more bulky and, as a result,
              accelerate the reading process.<br>
              <br>
              Segmentation at the highest nodes: Subtitled text should
              appear segmented at the highest syntactic nodes possible.
              This means that each subtitle flash should ideally contain
              one complete sentence. In cases where the sentence cannot
              fit in a single-line subtitle and has to continue over a
              second line or even over a new subtitle flash, the
              segmentation on each of the lines should be arranged to
              coincide with the highest syntactic node possible. For
              example, before we segment the phrase:<br>
              <br>
              "The destruction of the city was inevitable." (44
              characters),<br>
              <br>
              we first have to think of its syntactic tree as follows:<br>
              <br>
              (N1) Sentence<br>
              (N2)
              Subject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


              +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


              Predicate<br>
              (N3) Noun
              phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


              +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


              Verb phrase<br>
              (N4) Noun phrase + Prepositional phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              +&nbsp;&nbsp; Verb + Complement<br>
              (N5) Noun phrase + Proposition + Noun phrase + Verb +
              Complement<br>
              (N6) Article + Noun + Prep + Article + Noun +&nbsp; Verb +
              Adjective<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; destruction
              of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              city&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inevitable<br>
              <br>
              A segmentation on the fifth node (N5) would create the
              two-line subtitle<br>
              <br>
              "The destruction of the<br>
              city was inevitable."<br>
              <br>
              A segmentation on the second node (N2) would create the
              two-line subtitle<br>
              <br>
              "The destruction of the city<br>
              was inevitable."<br>
              <br>
              Out of the two segmentations, it is the second that flows
              as more readable. This occurs because the higher the node,
              the greater the grouping of the semantic load and the more
              complete the piece of information presented to the brain.
              When we segment a sentence, we force the brain to pause
              its linguistic processing for a while, until the eyes
              trace the next piece of linguistic information. In cases
              where segmentation is inevitable, therefore, we should try
              to force this pause on the brain at a point where the
              semantic load has already managed to convey a
              satisfactorily complete piece of information.<br>
              <br>
              Segmentation and line length: The upper line and the lower
              line of a two-line subtitle should be proportionally as
              equal in length as possible#, since the viewers' eye is
              more accustomed to reading text in a rectangular rather
              than a triangular format. This happens because the
              conventional text format of printed material is
              rectangular (in columns or pages). Taken into account the
              previous entry on "segmentation at the highest nodes,"
              this means that the segmentation of subtitled text should
              be a compromise between syntax and geometry. However, if
              we had to sacrifice the one for the sake of the other, we
              should prefer to sacrifice geometry.<br>
              <br>
              Spoken utterances and subtitled sentences: Each spoken
              utterance should ideally correspond to a subtitled
              sentence. The reason is that viewers expect a correct and
              faithful representation of the original text and one of
              the basic means to check this is by noticing if the number
              of the spoken utterances coincides with the number of the
              subtitled sentences. In other words, viewers expect to see
              the end of a subtitled sentence soon after they realise
              that the speaker has finished his/her utterance and before
              a new one begins. In this respect, merging or bridging two
              or more utterances into one subtitled sentence should be
              avoided as much as possible, unless spatio-temporal
              constraints strictly dictate it.<br>
              <br>
              More than one sentence on the same subtitle: No more than
              two sentences are allowed on the same subtitle. Following
              the principle of "segmentation at the highest nodes,"#;
              they should occupy one line each, no matter whether they
              correspond to utterances produced by the same speaker
              (monologue) or by different speakers (dialogue). If they
              correspond to a monologue, they should be centralised like
              normal subtitled text. If they correspond to a dialogue,
              they should be left-aligned and preceded by dashes
              ("double text").<br>
              <br>
              Omitting linguistic items of the original: A decision as
              to which pieces of information to omit or to include
              should depend on the relative contribution of these pieces
              of information to the comprehension and appreciation of
              the target film as a whole. The subtitler should not
              attempt to transfer everything, even when this is
              spatio-temporally feasible. The subtitler should attempt
              to keep a fine balance between retaining a maximum of the
              original text (essential for the comprehension of the
              linguistic part of the target film), and allowing ample
              time for the eye to process the rest of the non-linguistic
              aural and visual elements (essential for the appreciation
              of the aesthetic part of the target film). Categories of
              linguistic items that could be omitted are as follows:<br>
              <br>
              Padding expressions(e.g. "you know," "well," "as I say"
              etc): These expressions are most frequently empty of
              semantic load and their presence is mostly functional,
              padding-in speech in order to maintain the desired speech
              flow.<br>
              <br>
              Tautological cumulative adjectives/adverbs (e.g. "great
              big," "super extra," "teeny weeny" etc): The first part of
              these double adjectival/adverbial combinations has an
              emphatic role which can be incorporated in a single-word
              equivalent (e.g. "huge," "extremely," "tiny").<br>
              <br>
              Responsive expressions (e.g. "yes," "no," "ok," "please,"
              "thanks," "thank you," "sorry"). The afore-listed
              expressions have been found to be recognised and
              comprehended by the majority of the European people, when
              clearly uttered, and could therefore be omitted from the
              subtitle. It should be noted, however, that when they are
              not clearly uttered or when they are presented in a slang,
              informal or colloquial version (e.g. "yup," "nup,"
              "okey-dokey," "tha" etc) they are not recognisable or
              comprehensible and should, therefore, be subtitled.<br>
              <br>
              Retaining linguistic items of the original: Linguistic
              items of the original that can be easily recognised and
              comprehended by the viewers should not only be retained if
              they appear in a context of unrecognisable items which
              blurs the meaning of the total utterance, but they should
              also be translated word-for-word. These items are most
              frequently proper nouns (e.g. geographical names like "Los
              Angeles," "Africa" etc.) or items that the target language
              has directly borrowed from or lent to the source language
              or happened to have in common after they both borrowed it
              from a third language (e.g. the items "mathematics,"
              "mathématique" and "mathimatika" shared by English, French
              and Greek respectively). Investigations in the psychology
              of viewing indicate that when such linguistic items are
              recognised by the viewers, the exact, literal,
              translationally equivalent items are expected to appear in
              the subtitles as well. This occurs because of the constant
              presence of an inherently operating checking mechanism in
              the brain of the viewers which raises the suspicions that
              the translation of the original text is not "properly" or
              "correctly" rendered in the subtitles, every time
              word-for-word translations for such items are not spotted.<br>
              <br>
              Altering syntactic structures: Simpler syntactic
              structures (canonical forms) tend to be both shorter and
              easier to understand than complex syntactic structures and
              should, therefore, be preferred, provided that a fine
              balance is achieved between a) semantic aspects
              (maintaining the semantic load of the original), b)
              pragmatic aspects (maintaining the function of the
              original), and c) stylistics (maintaining the stylistics
              features of the original). Categories of complex syntactic
              structures could be replaced by simplified ones as
              follows:<br>
              <br>
              Active for passive constructions: E.g. "It is believed by
              many people." (30 characters) =&gt; "Many people believe."
              (20 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Positive for negative expressions: E.g. "We went to a
              place we hadn't been before." (41 characters) =&gt; "We
              went to a new place." (23 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Temporal Prepositional Phrases for temporal subordinate
              clauses: E.g. "I'll study when I finish watching this
              movie." (46 characters) =&gt; "I'll study after this
              movie." (28 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Modified nouns for the referring relative clauses: E.g.
              "What I'd like is a cup of coffee." (33 characters) =&gt;
              "I'd like a cup of coffee." (25 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Gapping for double verb insertion: E.g. "John would like
              to work in Germany and Bill would like to work in France."
              (73 characters) =&gt; "John would like to work in Germany
              and Bill in France."#; (54 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Straightforward question sentences for indicative
              pragmatic requests: E.g. "I would like to know if you are
              coming." (39 characters) =&gt; "Are you coming?" (15
              characters).<br>
              <br>
              Straightforward imperative sentences for indicative
              pragmatic requests: E.g. "I would like you to give me my
              keys back." (41 characters) =&gt; "Give me my keys back."
              (21 characters).<br>
              <br>
              In certain cases, however, it is longer structures that
              have to be preferred because they facilitate mental
              processing:<br>
              <br>
              Coherent phrase grouping for syntactical scrambling: E.g.
              "That a man should arrive with long hair did not surprise
              me." (60 characters) =&gt; "It did not surprise me that a
              man with long hair should arrive." (63 characters).<br>
              <br>
              Acronyms, apostrophes, numerals and symbols: Acronyms,
              apostrophes and symbols can save precious character space
              by abbreviating meaning signs. However, they should be
              used with caution and only if they are immediately
              recognisable and comprehensible. For example:<br>
              <br>
              Acronyms: Use acronyms like "NATO" and "USA" but avoid
              acronyms like "PM" (Prime Minister) or "DC" (Detective
              Constable).<br>
              <br>
              Apostrophes: Use apostrophes for abbreviations of
              auxiliaries like "I'd like" and "You can't" but avoid
              abbreviations like "Mid'bro" (Middlesborough).<br>
              <br>
              Numerals: For numerals, the conventions of printed
              materials should be followed, i.e. they should be used to
              indicate numbers over twelve "He is only 25" but not other
              numeric expressions like "1000s of times" or "the 2 of
              us."<br>
              <br>
              Symbols: Use symbols commonly used and immediately
              recognised on printed materials like "%" and avoid less
              common symbols like "&amp;" or "@."<br>
              <br>
              Rendering dialects: If a dialect of the target language
              (regional or social) is chosen to be used on the subtitled
              text, it should not be rendered as a phonetic or syntactic
              transcription of the spoken form. Only dialects that have
              already appeared in a written form in printed materials
              are allowed to be used in subtitles as well. For example,
              archaic or biblical forms like "thee" for "you" are
              allowed but sociolect forms like "whadda ya doin?" are not
              allowed because they are not immediately recognisable and
              comprehensible by the viewers' eye.<br>
              <br>
              Taboo words: Taboo words should not be censored unless
              their frequent repetition dictates their reduction for
              reasons of text economy.<br>
              <br>
              Culture-specific linguistic elements: There is no standard
              guideline for the transfer of culture-specific linguistic
              elements. There are five possible alternatives for such a
              transfer: a) cultural transfer, b) transposition, c)
              transposition with explanation, d) neutralisation (plain
              explanation), e) omission. The culture specific element
              "10 Downing Street" (the British Prime Minister's
              Residence), for example, in the expression "They were
              following orders from 10 Downing Street" could be
              transferred as follows:<br>
              <br>
              Cultural Transfer: "They were following orders from
              ________," filling the gap with the respective name of the
              Prime Minister's Residence (e.g. Matignon for France,
              Megaro Maximou for Greece etc.)<br>
              <br>
              Transposition: "They were following orders from 10 Downing
              Street"<br>
              <br>
              Transposition with explanation: "They were following
              orders from 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's House"<br>
              <br>
              Neutralisation: "They were following orders from the Prime
              Minister"<br>
              <br>
              Omission: "They were following orders"<br>
              <br>
              The choice of which alternative to apply depends on the
              culture-specific linguistic element itself, as well as on
              the broader, contextual, linguistic or non-linguistic
              aural and visual situation in which it is embedded.<br>
